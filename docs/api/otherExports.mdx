# Other Exports

Redux Toolkit exports some of its internal utilities, and re-exports additional functions from other dependencies as well.

### `nanoid`

An inlined copy of [`nanoid/nonsecure`](https://github.com/ai/nanoid). Generates a non-cryptographically-secure random ID string. Automatically used by `createAsyncThunk` for request IDs, but may also be useful for other cases as well.

```ts
import { nanoid } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'

console.log(nanoid())
// 'dgPXxUz_6fWIQBD8XmiSy'
```

## Exports from Other Libraries

### `createNextState`

The default immutable update function from the [`immer` library](https://immerjs.github.io/immer/), re-exported here as `createNextState` (also commonly referred to as [`produce`](https://immerjs.github.io/immer/docs/produce))

### `current`

[The `current` function](https://immerjs.github.io/immer/docs/current) from the [`immer` library](https://immerjs.github.io/immer/), which takes a snapshot of the current state of a draft and finalizes it (but without freezing). Current is a great utility to print the current state during debugging, and the output of `current` can also be safely leaked outside the producer.

### `original`

[The `original` function](https://immerjs.github.io/immer/docs/original) from the [`immer` library](https://immerjs.github.io/immer/), which returns the original object. This is particularly useful for referential equality check in reducers.

```ts
import { createReducer, createAction, current } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'

interface Todo {
  //...
}
const addTodo = createAction<Todo>('addTodo')

const initialState: Todo[] = []

const todosReducer = createReducer(initialState, builder => {
  builder.addCase(addTodo, (state, action) => {
    state.push(action.payload)
    console.log(current(state))
  })
})
```

### `combineReducers`

Redux's [`combineReducers`](https://redux.js.org/api/combinereducers), re-exported for convenience. While `configureStore` calls this internally, you may wish to call it yourself to compose multiple levels of slice reducers.

### `compose`

Redux's [`compose`](https://redux.js.org/api/compose). It composes functions from right to left.
This is a functional programming utility. You might want to use it to apply several store custom enhancers/ functions in a row.

### `bindActionCreators`

Redux's [`bindActionCreators`](https://redux.js.org/api/bindactioncreators). It wraps action creators with `dispatch()` so that they dispatch immediately when called.

### `createStore`

Redux's [`createStore`](https://redux.js.org/api/createstore). You should not need to use this directly.

### `applyMiddleware`

Redux's [`applyMiddleware`](https://redux.js.org/api/applymiddleware). You should not need to use this directly.
